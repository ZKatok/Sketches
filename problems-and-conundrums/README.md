Problems and conundrums to solve throughout the year for Sage Ridge School coding students. Please **fork** this repository to your account and then clone it to your laptop drive before beginning. Solutions will be considered to have been "turned in" when you have pushed them to your github **problems-and-conundrums-solutions** repository fork adding the word "final commit" to the commit description. I encourage you to add comments to the optional extended description when necessary.
